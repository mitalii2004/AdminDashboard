    <td>Use data to pick the right questions?</td>
    <td>
      To really meet your customers where they are, harness your CRM data to
      discover the most common questions across all channels and see how support
      reps categorize them. Ask your reps to keep logs of unusually helpful
      solutions they’ve shared with customers while they’re on support calls,
      too. If the questions to these answers are straightforward enough, add
      them to the FAQ page. Another way to figure out what questions to answer
      is to have non-native users pilot your site and products. Then, ask them
      if they found any aspects confusing. This gives you the “outsider”
      perspective you may not be able to find with your deeper knowledge of your
      brand

    <td>Are FAQs good for SEO?</td>
    <td>
      FAQ pages and help centers, in general, are great for SEO. Customers have
      adopted a “Google it” mantra when it comes to customer service. They check
      a company’s online resources first when they run into trouble and prefer
      self-service because it’s quick and convenient. Instead of making your
      customers wander through the pages of Google, optimizing your FAQ page
      helps them find information faster.

    <td>Where can you put an FAQ page?</td>
    <td>
      You can put an FAQ page inside your help center, on a checkout or product
      page, or anywhere where your customers might get stuck. You can also
      deploy a chatbot to answer FAQs anywhere on your website or mobile app.

    <td>4.</td>
    <td>Do you need an FAQ page?</td>
    <td>
      Are your agents spending too much time answering the same basic questions
      over and over again? That's a good indicator that you need an FAQ page. An
      FAQ page is also a great place to start when building a help center. When
      creating a knowledge base, it helps to start by writing articles for the
      most frequently asked questions and then continuously expand on that
      content. Look for common one-touch tickets—the ones resolved with a simple
      response. These have likely already have been written internally by a
      product or documentation team. They can be published quickly as FAQ
      articles on a growing knowledge base or even handed over to a chatbot.
